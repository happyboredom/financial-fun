Hour 0 - 1
----
* I know relatively little about react and all the front-end architecture. Best way to figure this out is to learn-by-doing.
* I arbitrarily picked `react-boilerplate` because it's the first thing I Googled
* set up and install `react-boilerplate`
* I had previously installed and configured Atom+nuclide to get all the FB tooling. That work is paying off now.
* so many new things to learn here... need to figure out how these work:
  * webpack
  * redux
  * ES6/7 syntax

Hour 1-2: the webpack rathole
----
* can I integrate Foundation CSS into webpack?
* how does webpack work...
* give up on adding Foundation for now. Learning webpack seems out of scope for now.

Hours 2-3: general tinkering with react components
----
* I haven't touched react in a couple of years. Need to reacquaint myself.
* Make a basic react component `RiskButton`
 * from boilerplate ... `npm run generate`
 * Ecmascript 6/7 syntax is so different from what plain old JS...

Hours 3-4:
----
* how does a component interact with redux?
 * intro to redux... 2pm..
 * the `react-boilerplate` is very opinionated on structure. It is taking some time to understand what parts I need to edit.
 * creating my first reducer.
